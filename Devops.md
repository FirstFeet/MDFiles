    Devops Intro
    Devops - Periodic table - https://digital.ai/learn/devsecops-periodic-table
Seven stages of devops
    Code management - Git, GitHUb, BitBucket
        version Control Repository
        Process of code management
        Code Versioning
        Code Versioning types
            LocalVersion Control
            Centralised Control system
            Distrubuted Version controlling system
        Git Components
            Working dir (Git Add)
            Staging Dir (git Commit)
            Local Repo (git push) 
            Remote Repo ()
        Git Commands
        Git Vs Github
        pull vs fetch
    Continous Integration - Jenkins
        CI/CD - Tool
        Pipeline
        It Integrates Code mgmt tool with testing and build tools
        Platform Independence - runs on java
        Extensive Plugin support
        CI - Automated Testing,Deployment, Code Changes, Speeding, 
        C:/progam/jenkins/secrets/initialAdmin
        Create a Job and Configure it
        Schedule a job
        Queuing Concept - Sequence of build
            Upstream0
            DownStream
        Build Trigger
            Periodically trigger - using corn tab
            Remote trigger - we will have a url with token in it. Whenever it is called the build will trigger
        User Management in Jenkins
        Security Policy
        Plugin Install
        Role based Authorization
            Global roles
            Item roles
            Jenkins user database
            Assign roles
            Jenking Dashboard
    Continous Monitoring - Splunk, Promuthus, grafana
        
    Continous configuration - (IAAC) - Ansible, terraform, puppet, chef
        IAC -Infrastructure as Code
        Terraform
            Automate provishing Infra
            Using Code, Script
            StateFile in terraform
                Scale up
                Scale down
            Imperative Approach
            Declaritive Approach
            Consistency
            Automation
            Version Control
            Colobrate - Multi task with different resource
            Scalablity - Up and Down
            Multi Cloud Provisining
            History of Terraform
                HCL Language
            Create a sample one to create VPC
    Continous Deployment - Docker, DockerSwan, Kubernetes
    Continous Testing - Selinium, JUNIT
        SonarCube
    Continous feedback - Analytics tools
