Kubernetes
    deploying containerised applications.
    Kubernetes used to manage the State of Containers.
        Start Containers on Specific Nodes.
        Restart Containers when gets Killed.
        Move containers one Node to Another.
    Features of Kubernetes 
        ➤ Automated Scheduling : Kubernetes provides advanced scheduler to
        launch container on cluster nodes based on their resource
        requirements and other constraints.
        ➤ Healing Capabilities: Kubernetes allows to replaces and reschedules
        containers when nodes die. Kubernetes doesn’t allow Containers to
        use, until they get ready.
        ➤ Auto Upgrade and RollBack : Kubernetes rolls out changes to the
        application or its configuration.
        Monitoring Application ensure that Kubernetes doesn’t kill all
        Instance at that time.
        If something goes wrong, with Kubernetes you can rollback the
        change.
        ➤ Horizontal Scaling : Kubernetes can scale up and scale down
        the application as per the requirements with a simple
        command, using a UI, or automatically based on CPU usage.
        ➤ Storage Orchestration : With Kubernetes, you can mount
        the storage system of your choice. You can either opt for local
        storage, or choose a public cloud provider.
        ➤ Secret & Configuration Management : Kubernetes can help
        you deploy and update secrets and application configuration
        without rebuilding your image and without exposing secrets
        in your stack configuration.
        ➤ You can Run Kubernetes Anywhere:
            On-Premise(Own DataCenter)
            Public Cloud(Google, AWS, Azure, DigitalOcean…)
            Hybrid Cloud
